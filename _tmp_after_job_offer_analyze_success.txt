{"success":true,"response":"Quick review + concise, actionable edits to improve match for technical project / operations leader roles. Pick which edits you'd like me to apply (I will wait for your approval before making session changes).\n\n### Top strengths (keep/lean into)\n- Clear operations + quality leadership background (Leiter Qualität, Direktor).  \n- Experience building/operating sites and managing cross-functional teams.  \n- Concrete technical skills (FMEA, CAPEX/OPEX, Baustellenmanagement) and interest in automation/AI.\n\n### Key gaps & risks\n- Profile sentence is cut off and needs a strong 2–3 line summary tailored to senior project/operations roles.  \n- Work bullets are mostly task-focused; few quantified outcomes (costs saved, % improvements, team size by project, budget sizes).  \n- Recent role titles/dates: consider highlighting director-level achievements from GL Solutions (2020–2025) with measurable impact.  \n- Language proficiency should use standard CV labels (e.g., German: B1/B2) if you know the CEFR level.\n\n### Concrete edits I suggest\n1) Finish and sharpen the Profile to 2–3 lines (value statement + 2 strengths + target role).  \n2) Convert 1–2 bullets per role into achievement statements with metrics (e.g., “Reduced product claims by 70%”, “Delivered X EUR projects”, “Managed €Y CAPEX, team of Z”).  \n3) Add a short “Selected achievements” 3-bullet section at top of Work Experience (quick wins for recruiters).  \n4) Standardize date formats to YYYY or YYYY–YYYY and locations for consistency.  \n5) Replace vague language levels with CEFR if you can (e.g., Deutsch B1/B2).\n\n### Suggested rewrite examples (copy-ready)\n- Profile (example): “Project & Operations Leader with 10+ years delivering infrastructure and quality systems for public and private sectors. Proven track record building Greenfield sites, leading cross-functional teams (up to 35 people) and reducing product returns through data-driven process improvements. Seeking Senior Project / Operations roles where I can combine field execution and systems optimisation.”  \n- Bullet (Expondo): “Led 3 departments (35 people); introduced KPI dashboards and process changes that reduced product claims by 70% and improved SLA compliance by X%.”  \n- Bullet (GL Solutions): “Planned and delivered road & infrastructure projects; managed subcontractor network and compliance for projects up to €XXk, improving on-time delivery from A% to B%.”\n\n### Next steps / quick questions for you\n1) Do you want me to: (A) apply these edits now to the session, or (B) propose a full reworded draft for your approval first?  \n2) Can you provide any metrics (costs, % improvements, team sizes per project, budgets) for GL Solutions and Imbodden AG?  \n3) Do you know your German CEFR level (e.g., B1/B2)?\n\n**Please confirm:**\n1.
