Translate education entries to professional, concise ATS-friendly {target_language}. For each entry, preserve degree, field, university, graduation date. Expand abbreviations (e.g., "MGR" → "Master's"); add relevance hint (e.g., "foundational for ML roles" or "enterprise architecture focus"). Output JSON: {education_entries: [{degree, field_of_study, institution, graduation_date, notes}]}.
