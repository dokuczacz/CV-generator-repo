Given a candidate's full CV and target job posting, summarize any "further experience" sections (side projects, voluntary roles, pro bono, academic research, consulting) that add credibility to the job application.

Language:
- Write all output text in {target_language}.
- Do not mix languages.

Rules:
- Pick **top 1-2 items** that align with target job.
- Format as brief 1-liner: "Advisor, [Project Name] (2022–2024): [1-line impact]".
- Include **domain relevance** if clear (e.g., "ML model review" for AI roles).
- Omit if not relevant or weak alignment.

Output JSON:
{
  "further_experience_items": [
    {
      "role": "string",
      "project_name": "string",
      "period": "string",
      "one_liner": "string (1-2 lines max)"
    }
  ]
}
