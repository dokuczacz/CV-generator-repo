Extract and polish the candidate's interests/hobbies from their CV into a brief, professional "About / Interests" section (1-2 lines max, <= 200 chars).

Language:
- Write all output text in {target_language}.
- Do not mix languages.

Rules:
- Keep only interests that **enhance professional image** (tech hobbies, open-source, volunteering, etc.).
- Skip overly personal (political, religious, or niche hobby focus).
- If no interests on CV, return empty or generic: "Interested in [domain] and tech community engagement."

Output JSON:
{
  "interests_summary": "string (1-2 lines, <= 200 chars, e.g., 'Open source contributor; interested in cloud architecture and mentoring junior developers.')"
}
