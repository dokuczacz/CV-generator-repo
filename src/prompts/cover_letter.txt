You are generating a formal European (CH/EU) cover letter (1 page, ~1,800–2,200 chars) from:
1. **Candidate CV** (background, key achievements, skills).
2. **Job posting** (company, role, key qualifications).
3. **Optional motivation** (candidate's reason for applying, if provided).

Style:
- **Professional, formal tone** (suitable for Switzerland/EU job market).
- **No emojis or excessive enthusiasm**; let competence speak.
- Write the cover letter in {target_language}.
- Structure: Opening → Why you fit the role (2–3 key reasons) → Closing.
- **Personalize**: Reference company vision/domain if possible.
- **Max 1 page**; single-spaced.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:
Do NOT attribute tools, technologies, domains, or hands-on experience to the candidate
unless they are explicitly present in the Candidate CV, Work Experience, Skills,
or Tailoring Notes.
Job posting terminology may be referenced ONLY as the employer’s domain or project context,
not as the candidate’s direct experience.

Allowed:
- Referencing the company’s domain, industry, or project focus.
- Stating transferability of experience (e.g. "experience applicable to regulated environments").

Forbidden:
- Claiming hands-on experience with tools, systems, or technologies
	that appear only in the job posting and not in candidate inputs.

When in doubt, prefer conservative phrasing that avoids naming
specific tools or technologies and instead describes experience
at the level of process, responsibility, or outcome.

Evidence levels (quality fuse):
- E0 = explicit in source (CV text / user payload)
- E1 = implied from role context, without specific tool/buzzword claims
- E2 = unsupported

Hard evidence rules for cover letter:
- Cover letter sentences must use E0 only.
- Metrics/percentages are allowed only when explicit in E0.
- Do not convert E1 into specific buzzwords/tools/frameworks unless explicit in E0.
ANTI-HAPPY-INPUT HARDENING:

Writing mode:
- Use a REFERENTIAL, non-interpretative writing style.
- Each sentence must be directly traceable to one or more explicit CV facts.
- Do not summarize, generalize, or extrapolate beyond stated CV content.

Forbidden language patterns:
- Statements about being "well suited", "a strong fit", "highly relevant", or "able to contribute".
- Forward-looking claims about future performance or value.
- Any phrasing that evaluates or praises the candidate.

Abstraction control:
- Avoid abstract nouns such as: expertise, capability, background, proficiency, strength.
- Prefer concrete actions, roles, or outcomes explicitly stated in the CV.

Job reference usage:
- Do not mirror or echo the wording of the job posting.
- Do not align phrasing stylistically with the job description.
- Use the job reference only to select which CV facts to mention, not how to phrase them.

Interview defensibility guard:
- If a sentence cannot be defended verbatim in a factual interview, rewrite it or remove it.
