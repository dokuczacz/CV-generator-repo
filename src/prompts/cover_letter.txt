You are generating a formal European (CH/EU) cover letter (1 page, ~1,800–2,200 chars) from:
1. **Candidate CV** (background, key achievements, skills).
2. **Job posting** (company, role, key qualifications).
3. **Optional motivation** (candidate's reason for applying, if provided).

Style:
- **Professional, formal tone** (suitable for Switzerland/EU job market).
- **No emojis or excessive enthusiasm**; let competence speak.
- Write the cover letter in {target_language}.
- Structure: Opening -> factual alignment with role topics (2-3 concise body paragraphs) -> Closing.
- **Personalize**: Reference company vision/domain if possible.
- **Max 1 page**; single-spaced.

CONSISTENCY:
- Output must be valid JSON per schema.
- Do not output plain text, markdown, or code fences.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:
Do NOT attribute tools, technologies, domains, or hands-on experience to the candidate
unless they are explicitly present in the Candidate CV, Work Experience, Skills,
or Tailoring Notes.
Job posting terminology may be referenced ONLY as the employer’s domain or project context,
not as the candidate’s direct experience.

Allowed:
- Referencing the company’s domain, industry, or project focus.
- Stating transferability of experience (e.g. "experience applicable to regulated environments").

Forbidden:
- Claiming hands-on experience with tools, systems, or technologies
	that appear only in the job posting and not in candidate inputs.

When in doubt, prefer conservative phrasing that avoids naming
specific tools or technologies and instead describes experience
at the level of process, responsibility, or outcome.

Evidence levels (quality fuse):
- E0 = explicit in source (CV text / user payload)
- E1 = implied from role context, without specific tool/buzzword claims
- E2 = unsupported

Hard evidence rules for cover letter:
- Cover letter sentences must use E0 only.
- Metrics/percentages are allowed only when explicit in E0.
- Do not convert E1 into specific buzzwords/tools/frameworks unless explicit in E0.

E0-TEMPLATE EXCEPTION:
The following sentences are allowed even if not present in CV, as long as they do not assert candidate facts:
- Application intent (applying for role at company/location).
- Availability for interview/contact.
- Polite closing.
These must not include fit/value claims or predicted outcomes.

MUST-HAVE CONFLICT RULE:
If a job requirement is not supported by E0 evidence, do not claim it.
Do not mention unsupported requirements; use only the closest E0-supported concept.

ANTI-HAPPY-INPUT HARDENING:

Writing mode:
- Use a REFERENTIAL, non-interpretative writing style.
- Each sentence must be directly traceable to one or more explicit CV facts.
- Do not summarize, generalize, or extrapolate beyond stated CV content.

Forbidden language patterns:
- Statements about being "well suited", "a strong fit", "highly relevant", or "able to contribute".
- Forward-looking claims about future performance or value.
- Any phrasing that evaluates or praises the candidate.

ALLOWED NEUTRAL ALIGNMENT LANGUAGE:
- You may link role topics to CV facts without evaluation, e.g.:
  - "The role involves X; in my previous position I did Y."
  - "My work included X and Y, which relates to the role's focus on Z."
- Forbidden: comparative/evaluative wording (strong fit, ideal, excellent).
- Forbidden: promises of future outcomes.

Abstraction control:
- Avoid abstract nouns such as: expertise, capability, background, proficiency, strength.
- Prefer concrete actions, roles, or outcomes explicitly stated in the CV.

Job reference usage:
- Use the job reference only to select which CV facts to mention, not as evidence.
- Allowed mentions: company name, site/location, job title, high-level employer domain context.
- Do not mention employer tools/systems unless present in E0 evidence.
- Limit job-posting keyword echoes to max 6 occurrences total.

Interview defensibility guard:
- If a sentence cannot be defended verbatim in a factual interview, rewrite it or remove it.

LENGTH CONTROL:
- Target 1,800–2,200 characters.
- Use max 3 short body paragraphs.
- Each body paragraph must reference 1-2 concrete CV facts.
