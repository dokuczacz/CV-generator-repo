Your task is to derive two complementary skill sections from the candidate's CV + job posting:
1. **Technical Skills** (programming languages, frameworks, tools, cloud platforms, databases).
2. **AI / ML Skills** (if relevant to job: prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, LLMs, data science, etc.).

Language:
- Write all output text in {target_language}.
- Do not mix languages.

Rules:
- **Max 8-10 skills per section**.
- List only skills **backed by CV experience** (not wishful thinking).
- **Prioritize alignment with job posting** keywords (e.g., if job asks for PyTorch, rank PyTorch high).
- For AI/ML: only include if CV shows substantive experience (not "took an online course").
- Use **short, ATS-friendly names** (Python, JavaScript, React, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, etc.).

Output JSON:
{
  "technical_skills": ["skill1", "skill2", ...],
  "ai_ml_skills": ["skill1", "skill2", ...],
  "expert_level": ["skill1 (10+ yrs)"],
  "gap_note": "string (if any critical job skill is missing from CV)"
}
