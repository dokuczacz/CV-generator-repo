{"success":true,"response":"Quick review of your session and three concise, prioritized edits to improve job fit and clarity.\n\n### Top issues (high impact)\n1) Profile is truncated and ends mid-sentence — completes your narrative and adds 2–3 quantified achievements. 2) Work bullets are descriptive but mostly task-focused — convert to achievement statements with metrics/scale where possible. 3) German-language phrases remain in some fields (dates, location labels, language levels) — standardize to English for international roles.\n\n### Proposed edits (apply next)\n1) Complete & sharpen Profile (2–3 lines): lead with role target + 1–2 core competencies + 1 quantified outcome (e.g., “10+ years leading infrastructure projects, built Greenfield sites delivering X value / reduced defects by Y%”).\n2) Convert each work_experience bullet into achievement format (Action — Result — Metric). Example for Expondo: “Led 3 departments (35 staff) and introduced KPI dashboards that reduced claims by 70% and improved time-to-resolution by X days.”\n3) Standardize formatting: use full date ranges (e.g., Jan 2020 – Apr 2025), translate/normalize language proficiency (e.g., Polish — Native; English — Fluent; German — B1/B2), and convert location names to English where appropriate.\n\n### Low-effort quick wins (do first)\n- Finish profile sentence and add 1 measurable accomplishment.\n- Add one quantified bullet to GL Solutions (e.g., project count/value, team size, on-time %).\n- Replace truncated date “2025-05” with full range or month-year role start/end notation.\n\n### Risks / missing clarifications\n- Some achievements need numbers you may not recall precisely (project € value, % improvement, headcount). Estimated ranges are acceptable but flag as estimates.\n- If you want to target a specific role (e.g., Project Manager, Site Manager, Quality Director), we should tailor the profile and choose which achievements to foreground.\n\n**Please confirm:**\n1. Do you want the CV targeted at construction/site operations roles or quality/process/operations leadership roles?\n   - Construction / Site Operations\n   - Quality / Process / Operations Leadership\n   - Hybrid / Both\n2. Can you provide any measurable outcomes for GL Solutions and Imbodden AG (project values, team sizes, percent improvements, delivery/on-time rates)?","pdf_base64":"","session_id":"b5207f16-a362-4dce-af51-8db2f08cb5d2","trace_id":"4342ec4a-8829-4e7b-bd75-ad8b6af5532e","stage":"review_session","run_summary":{"trace_id":"4342ec4a-8829-4e7b-bd75-ad8b6af5532e","steps":[{"step":"model_call","index":1,"duration_ms":15181,"tool_calls":0}],"max_model_calls":5,"model_calls":1,"execution_mode":false,"stage_debug":{"current_stage":"REVIEW","next_stage":"REVIEW","edit_intent":false,"generate_requested":false,"confirmation_required":false,"user_confirm_yes":false,"user_confirm_no":false,"validation_passed":true,"readiness_ok":true,"pending_edits":0,"turns_in_review":1,"version_before":10,"version_after":12,"readiness_after":{"can_generate":true,"required_present":{"full_name":true,"email":true,"phone":true,"work_experience":true,"education":true},"strict_template":false,"confirmed_flags":{"contact_confirmed":true,"education_confirmed":true,"confirmed_at":"2026-01-28T01:53:25.598900"},"missing":[]}}},"turn_trace":[],"ui_action":null}
